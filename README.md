<h1>Sales Performance Dashboard</h1>
What makes a purpose driven effective dashboard, 3 things come to mind.

1. Track metrics that matter and we can be influenced – similar to this dashboard metrics Sales, Customers and Profit. 

2. Context is important – how are the metrics progressing overtime in comparison to previous period or target.

3. Breakdown by categorical values - like a sub-category, segment, state... to understand where the bulk and least of the Sales, Profit or Customers come from.

At a quick glance it should provide an insight of what's important to look into, as an example Sub-Category: Machines, has a reduction in sales by 22% from previous year, do we know what has caused it? Perhaps a new competitor? What is the customers feedback? Etc 

The insipration to build this dashboard came from Injae Park's work on native visuals in power bi youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Kn9jmgUlnY

<h1>Overview</h1>
I have built this power bi dashboard that helps in answering the following questions

- What may be the reason for this?
  
- How satisfied are the customers with the chair purchases?
  
- Does our loyalty marketing for chairs differ?
  
- Is there added competition in the market?
  
- How does out product compare in quality, prices etc..?

I created % growth calculated fields using DAX, which is another way of showing trends. 

I find it useful to spot any trends especially when dealing with high volumes of categorical data like Sub-Categories, products etc.
