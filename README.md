This morning over a cup of coffee I’ve been reflecting on what makes a purpose driven effective dashboard, 3 things come to mind.

1. Track metrics that matter and we can be influenced – similar to this dashboard metrics Sales, Customers and Profit. 

2. Context is important – how are the metrics progressing overtime in comparison to previous period or target.

3. Breakdown by categorical values - like a sub-category, segment, state... to understand where the bulk and least of the Sales, Profit or Customers come from.

At a quick glance it should provide an insight of what's important to look into, as an example Sub-Category: Machines, has a reduction in sales by 22% from previous year, do we know what has caused it? Perhaps a new competitor? What is the customers feedback? Etc 

I was inspired to build this dashboard by Injae Park recent work on YouTube on how to create variance on bar charts.
